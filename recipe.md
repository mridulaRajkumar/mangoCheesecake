making middle and top layer of mango cheesecake
Cut the agar agar sticks and soak them in 1/2 cup of water for 20 to 25 mins in a small pan.
Peel and chop the mangoes. Prepare a smooth puree of the chopped mangoes in a blender. Divide the mango puree into two equal portions in separate bowls and keep aside.
In a another mixing bowl or pan, take the cream cheese, cream, vanilla extract and sugar.
With a wired whisk whip this mixture very well till smooth. You can also use a stand mixer or a hand held mixer or food processor.
Then add half of of the mango puree (i had 1 cup of mango puree) and gently mix it with the cream cheese mixture.
Now heat the pan containing the agar agar and water on a sim or low flame.
Keep on stirring and cook this mixture till the agar agar dissolves completely in the water and you see a smooth gelatinous liquid.
When the agar agar solution becomes warm, take equal portions of it. Add one portion of the warm agar agar solution to the mango cream cheese mixture and stir quickly and vigorously.
Add the remaining half portion to the mango puree and again stir quickly. If the mangoes are not sweet, then do add some sugar to this half of the mango puree before you add the agar agar solution.
In case, the agar agar solidifies, then reheat it again adding some water. You can also keep it on a hot water bath to melt it again.
Pour the mango cream cheese mixture on to the cracker crumb layer.
Shake the pan gently to spread even the cream cheese. With a spatula even the second mango cheese cake layer.
Keep the pan in the fridge for about 30 to 35 mins.
Remove and then layer the mango + agar agar mixture gently on the middle cream cheese layer. With a flat spatula spread the last layer carefully.
If the mango puree has become thick with the agar agar setting in it, then just lightly microwave it.
Cover the pan and keep in the refrigerator for the mango cheese cake to set for 3 to 4 hours.
Unmould carefully and then place the cheesecake on a serving tray or plate or cake stand.
Decorate with whipped cream, chopped mangoes, mint leaves or whatever you prefer.
Slice the mango cheese cake and serve immediately.
